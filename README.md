# VideoToASCII
Welcome to the VideoToASCII repo !

To use the script, just place the video you want to be converted in the folder next to the main.py file.
The video MUST be named "clip.mp4"

The result will be named "final.mp4".


To increase/reduce the sharpness of the ASCII mapping, just edit the STEP global variable in the asciiconverter.py file.


Prerequisites : Python 3.7, PIL, MoviePy, numpy. (Maplotlib is imported, but deprecated.)
